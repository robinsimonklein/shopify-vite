# Shopify-Vite theme starter
This template is a blank theme starter for Shopify using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for assets bundling. This unlocks the ability to easily use modern development methods like SCSS, npm packages, entry chunks...

It also uses [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) for the javascript code to augment the templates DOM with just enough behavior to make it shine.

## Getting started

First, [create a repo from this template on GitHub.](https://github.com/robinsimonklein/shopify-vite/generate)

### Installation

#### 1. Install project dependencies
```shell
yarn install
```

#### 2. Authenticate with Shopify CLI
You will first need to install the Shopify CLI. Go to the [shopify's docs](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli) to learn more.

Then, login into your store
```shell
shopify login --store johns-apparel.myshopify.com
```

### Development

Build `css` and `javascript` assets in watch mode during development :
```shell
yarn watch
```

And serve the theme with Shopify CLI to see the perview and edit theme 
```shell
shopify theme serve
```

<!-- TODO: Add folder structure explanation -->

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### Github Actions
This theme starter uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to maintain the quality of the theme.

#### Shopify/theme-check-action
Dawn runs [Theme Check](#Theme-Check) on every commit via [Shopify/theme-check-action](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-check-action).

### Deploy to shopify

You can deploy the theme for production by publishing a new release, or by manually running the "CI/CD" GitHub action by checking the *deploy theme* option.

The deployment is automatically done on an orphan branch named "shopify". You don't need to create this branch, it will be created automatically if it doesn't exist yet.

The *shopify* branch is cleaned of all files not needed for Shopify and respects the required theme [directory structure](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture#directory-structure-and-component-types). 
The `assets` folder contains the assets that are compiled and ready for production.

Publish this theme to Shopify via the **GitHub Integration** and selecting the `shopify` branch. The `main` branch can be used for a development/pre-production environment.
